		<h1> Hello, my name is Mason Pride </h1>
		<p> <span class="tab"></span>Orginally from Olathe, KS, I’m currently in Manhattan, KS attending Kansas State University. I’m a senior studying Integrated Computer Science with a minor in Graphic Design through the Arts and Sciences Department, and I plan to graduate in the Spring of 2024.  In my free time I like to do some game design mainly using the Unity Engine. I also like to lift weights and workout and plan on competing at some point.
